**Assignment Files Explaination**

The `src` folder contains all the files related to the project. I have used simple css to style the project as stated in the assignment instructions.

The `components` folder contains three subfolders, namely; `Assets`-: contains demo img of users.
`commentForm` -: folder contains the form component to create an new comment.
`comments` -: folder contains all the logic for displaying, deleting, updating and replying to a comment.
Due to lack of time, I haven't created the like-dislike functionality.

`utils` folder contains default data and some functions to demonstrate fetching comments through api.

**_On clicking `Refresh Button` in the top right all the previous data is deleted and progress is destroyed, application reaches it's by default state._**
